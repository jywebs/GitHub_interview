You should be prepared to answer all **three technical questions**, written as though responding to a customer in an email. Answers can be shared via slides or document format.

### Technical Questions

**Q1:**  
*We’re trying to standardize our branching strategies across teams. Team A is currently doing Git flow while Team B is doing Trunk-based Development. Which one is better? Which one should we pick?*

[Question 1 Research](Q1/README.md)
[TBD_Development Style Response](Q1/Trunk_Response.md)


**Q2:**  
*We currently have Jenkins OSS in house with each team managing their own instance. Can we migrate them to GitHub Actions ASAP? We use a standard set of plugins for interacting with our AWS and Azure environments for deployments.*

[Question 2 Research](Q2/README.md)
[JenkinsOSS to GH actions email response](Q2/JenkinsOSS_GH_Actions_email.md)

**Q3:**  
*We want to backup our cloud hosted Git repos to an internally, self-hosted git server, so that we can backup the cloud repos. How would we go about setting up a one way repo sync between the two?*
