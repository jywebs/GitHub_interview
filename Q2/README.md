Contains the research and potential clarifying questions for Email response Question 2

# Question 2
*We currently have Jenkins OSS in house with each team managing their own instance. Can we migrate them to GitHub Actions ASAP? We use a standard set of plugins for interacting with our AWS and Azure environments for deployments.*

## Quick Answer:
Yes, migrating to GitHub Actions is both feasible and can be executed quickly with the right approach. Below is how I recommend we move forward, along with what “ASAP” looks like in practical terms.

## Top 10 Clarifying Questions – With Risks Addressed

1. **How many Jenkins controllers/instances and active jobs are we migrating, and are they centrally managed or team-owned?**  
   - *Risk de-risked*: Underestimating migration scope, hidden complexity, missed dependencies.  

2. **Which AWS accounts and Azure subscriptions are in scope, and how do teams authenticate today (keys, service principals, Vault)?**  
   - *Risk de-risked*: Security exposure from long-lived credentials; incomplete OIDC setup.  

3. **Do any pipelines require private network access (e.g., VPC-only resources, on-prem endpoints)?**  
   - *Risk de-risked*: Deploy failures if jobs can’t reach resources; need for self-hosted runners.  

4. **Are there shared Jenkins libraries or global plugins that multiple teams depend on?**  
   - *Risk de-risked*: Loss of critical functionality; duplication of work across teams.  

5. **What operating systems or special environments are required for builds (Linux, Windows, macOS, GPU, large memory)?**  
   - *Risk de-risked*: Build failures or performance issues due to missing environments.  

6. **What level of governance is expected—do you need approvals, environment gates, or compliance/audit controls?**  
   - *Risk de-risked*: Non-compliance with security or audit requirements; failed audits.  

7. **How do you define “ASAP”—is there a hard deadline or are we targeting a phased 4–6 week rollout?**  
   - *Risk de-risked*: Misaligned expectations; rushing migration without stabilizing critical jobs.  

8. **Are you open to using GitHub-hosted runners for most workloads, or do you need private/self-hosted runners?**  
   - *Risk de-risked*: Unexpected cost overruns; networking/security gaps.  

9. **What is your risk tolerance for migration—big-bang cutover vs phased team-by-team approach?**  
   - *Risk de-risked*: Service interruptions; loss of trust from teams if migration fails mid-stream.  

10. **How much training and enablement do your teams expect during the transition (docs, workshops, office hours)?**  
   - *Risk de-risked*: Low adoption, shadow Jenkins usage, frustrated developers.  

## Research Needed to Answer the Jenkins → GitHub Actions Migration Question

### 1. Current Jenkins Landscape
- **Inventory controllers/instances**: How many, who owns them, and how they are maintained.  
- **Job types**: Build-only vs build+deploy vs infra provisioning vs cron/batch jobs.  
- **Shared libraries/plugins**: Which are global and which are repo-specific.  
- **Resource usage**: # of jobs/day, average runtime, and required executor environments.  

### 2. Plugin/Feature Parity
- **AWS plugins** → Research `aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials`, `setup-sam`, `setup-terraform`.  
- **Azure plugins** → Research `azure/login`, `azure/cli`, `azure/arm-deploy`.  
- **Pipeline libraries** → Research GitHub reusable workflows and composite actions.  
- **Artifacts & caching** → Research `actions/upload-artifact`, `actions/cache`.  
- **Notifications** → GitHub Checks API, PR comments, Slack integration actions.  

### 3. Identity & Security
- **How Jenkins authenticates today** (static keys, Vault, service principals).  
- **OIDC federation setup** for AWS (STS AssumeRole with conditions) and Azure (Entra federated credentials).  
- **Secret storage** best practices in GitHub (Org/Repo secrets, Environments, Variables).  
- **Compliance needs**: SOC2, ISO, FedRAMP — what governance GitHub provides out-of-the-box.  

### 4. Runner Strategy
- **GitHub-hosted runners**: Cost, performance, and supported environments.  
- **Self-hosted runners**: Installation, lifecycle management, labels, security.  
- **Actions Runner Controller (ARC)**: How it scales runners on Kubernetes and integrates into private networks.  
- **Special workloads**: Windows/macOS builds, GPU, large memory jobs.  

### 5. Migration Patterns
- **Lift & Shift**: Copy Jenkins shell steps into workflows, only swapping auth.  
- **Refactor to GitHub-native**: Use reusable workflows, GitHub Packages, caching, and Environments.  
- **Phased rollout**: Pilot with representative jobs, expand team by team, keep Jenkins in read-only mode until stable.  
- **Cutover timeline**: What “ASAP” means — weeks vs months.  

### 6. Governance & Compliance
- **Environments**: Deployment gates, required reviewers, wait timers.  
- **Branch protection / rulesets**: Enforcing checks before merging.  
- **Secret scanning / Dependabot**: How these help improve baseline security.  
- **Audit/logging**: What GitHub provides vs what Jenkins had (Blue Ocean, logs, etc.).  

### 7. Cost & ROI
- **Jenkins today**: VM costs, maintenance, plugin upgrades, support burden.  
- **GitHub Actions**: Pricing for minutes, storage, artifacts; cost of self-hosted runners.  
- **Operational ROI**: Time saved by removing Jenkins patching and plugin management.  

### 8. Training & Adoption
- **Developer enablement**: What training is needed to help teams write workflows.  
- **Reusable starter workflows**: Templates to accelerate adoption.  
- **Internal docs & support**: Office hours, Slack channels, migration playbooks.

**How to prep**:  
- Study GitHub Docs → Actions runners, OIDC for AWS & Azure, reusable workflows.  
- Compare Jenkins plugin list vs Actions equivalents.  
- Build 1–2 demo workflows (AWS deploy, Azure deploy) to show parity.  
- Gather cost data for GitHub-hosted runners vs self-hosted.  
- Prepare a migration “playbook” (discovery → pilot → scale → retire Jenkins).
