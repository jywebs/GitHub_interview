Contains the research and potential clarifying questions for Email response Question 2

# Question 2
*We currently have Jenkins OSS in house with each team managing their own instance. Can we migrate them to GitHub Actions ASAP? We use a standard set of plugins for interacting with our AWS and Azure environments for deployments.*

## Quick Answer:
Yes, migrating to GitHub Actions is both feasible and can be executed quickly with the right approach. Below is how I recommend we move forward, along with what “ASAP” looks like in practical terms.  
[Migration from Jenkins OSS to GitHub Actions – Feasibility and Path Forward](JenkinsOSS_GH_Actions_email.md)

## Top 10 Clarifying Questions – With Risks Addressed

1. **How many Jenkins controllers/instances and active jobs are we migrating, and are they centrally managed or team-owned?**  
   - *Risk de-risked*: Underestimating migration scope, hidden complexity, missed dependencies.  

2. **Which AWS accounts and Azure subscriptions are in scope, and how do teams authenticate today (keys, service principals, Vault)?**  
   - *Risk de-risked*: Security exposure from long-lived credentials; incomplete OIDC setup.  

3. **Do any pipelines require private network access (e.g., VPC-only resources, on-prem endpoints)?**  
   - *Risk de-risked*: Deploy failures if jobs can’t reach resources; need for self-hosted runners.  

4. **Are there shared Jenkins libraries or global plugins that multiple teams depend on?**  
   - *Risk de-risked*: Loss of critical functionality; duplication of work across teams.  

5. **What operating systems or special environments are required for builds (Linux, Windows, macOS, GPU, large memory)?**  
   - *Risk de-risked*: Build failures or performance issues due to missing environments.  

6. **What level of governance is expected—do you need approvals, environment gates, or compliance/audit controls?**  
   - *Risk de-risked*: Non-compliance with security or audit requirements; failed audits.  

7. **How do you define “ASAP”—is there a hard deadline or are we targeting a phased 4–6 week rollout?**  
   - *Risk de-risked*: Misaligned expectations; rushing migration without stabilizing critical jobs.  

8. **Are you open to using GitHub-hosted runners for most workloads, or do you need private/self-hosted runners?**  
   - *Risk de-risked*: Unexpected cost overruns; networking/security gaps.  

9. **What is your risk tolerance for migration—big-bang cutover vs phased team-by-team approach?**  
   - *Risk de-risked*: Service interruptions; loss of trust from teams if migration fails mid-stream.  

10. **How much training and enablement do your teams expect during the transition (docs, workshops, office hours)?**  
   - *Risk de-risked*: Low adoption, shadow Jenkins usage, frustrated developers.  

## Research Needed to Answer the Jenkins → GitHub Actions Migration Question

### 1. Current Jenkins Landscape
- **Inventory controllers/instances**: How many, who owns them, and how they are maintained.  
- **Job types**: Build-only vs build+deploy vs infra provisioning vs cron/batch jobs.  
- **Shared libraries/plugins**: Which are global and which are repo-specific.  
- **Resource usage**: # of jobs/day, average runtime, and required executor environments.  

### 2. Plugin/Feature Parity
- **AWS plugins** → Research `aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials`, `setup-sam`, `setup-terraform`.  
- **Azure plugins** → Research `azure/login`, `azure/cli`, `azure/arm-deploy`.  
- **Pipeline libraries** → Research GitHub reusable workflows and composite actions.  
- **Artifacts & caching** → Research `actions/upload-artifact`, `actions/cache`.  
- **Notifications** → GitHub Checks API, PR comments, Slack integration actions.  

### 3. Identity & Security
- **How Jenkins authenticates today** (static keys, Vault, service principals).  
- **OIDC federation setup** for AWS (STS AssumeRole with conditions) and Azure (Entra federated credentials).  
- **Secret storage** best practices in GitHub (Org/Repo secrets, Environments, Variables).  
- **Compliance needs**: SOC2, ISO, FedRAMP — what governance GitHub provides out-of-the-box.  

### 4. Runner Strategy
- **GitHub-hosted runners**: Cost, performance, and supported environments.  
- **Self-hosted runners**: Installation, lifecycle management, labels, security.  
- **Actions Runner Controller (ARC)**: How it scales runners on Kubernetes and integrates into private networks.  
- **Special workloads**: Windows/macOS builds, GPU, large memory jobs.  

### 5. Migration Patterns
- **Lift & Shift**: Copy Jenkins shell steps into workflows, only swapping auth.  
- **Refactor to GitHub-native**: Use reusable workflows, GitHub Packages, caching, and Environments.  
- **Phased rollout**: Pilot with representative jobs, expand team by team, keep Jenkins in read-only mode until stable.  
- **Cutover timeline**: What “ASAP” means — weeks vs months.  

### 6. Governance & Compliance
- **Environments**: Deployment gates, required reviewers, wait timers.  
- **Branch protection / rulesets**: Enforcing checks before merging.  
- **Secret scanning / Dependabot**: How these help improve baseline security.  
- **Audit/logging**: What GitHub provides vs what Jenkins had (Blue Ocean, logs, etc.).  

### 7. Cost & ROI
- **Jenkins today**: VM costs, maintenance, plugin upgrades, support burden.  
- **GitHub Actions**: Pricing for minutes, storage, artifacts; cost of self-hosted runners.  
- **Operational ROI**: Time saved by removing Jenkins patching and plugin management.  

### 8. Training & Adoption
- **Developer enablement**: What training is needed to help teams write workflows.  
- **Reusable starter workflows**: Templates to accelerate adoption.  
- **Internal docs & support**: Office hours, Slack channels, migration playbooks.

# Benefits of GitHub Actions vs Jenkins OSS

## 1. Security & Identity

- **Native OIDC federation** with AWS, Azure, and GCP eliminates long-lived cloud keys.  
- **Granular permissions**: Workflow-level `permissions:` blocks vs Jenkins’ global/shared credential stores.  
- **Built-in secret scanning** and dependency alerts improve the security baseline.  

**Business Value**: Reduced risk of credential leaks, compliance alignment, and fewer audit headaches.

---

## 2. Operational Efficiency

- **No servers to manage**: GitHub-hosted runners handle scaling, patching, and upgrades.  
- **Self-hosted flexibility**: Use Actions Runner Controller (ARC) on Kubernetes for private networking or custom jobs.  
- **Always up-to-date**: No plugin upgrade cycle or controller downtime for patching.  

**Business Value**: Lower TCO, reduced operational toil, and faster velocity for engineering teams.

---

## 3. Integration & Developer Experience

- **Workflows live with code**: YAML workflows in the same repo as the application.  
- **First-class GitHub integration**: Trigger on PRs, issues, comments, releases, or custom events.  
- **Reusable workflows & composite actions**: Replace Jenkins shared libraries with modular, versioned logic.  
- **Rich feedback loop**: Inline annotations in pull requests, summary views, and Checks API integration.  

**Business Value**: Developers stay in one platform, reducing context-switching and improving adoption.

---

## 4. Governance & Compliance

- **Environments**: Add approvals, required reviewers, and wait timers for production deploys.  
- **Repository rulesets & branch protection**: Enforce consistent policies across teams.  
- **Audit visibility**: All actions tied to GitHub identity with detailed logs.  

**Business Value**: Stronger governance without bolted-on tools; simpler audit prep.

---

## 5. Ecosystem & Extensibility

- **Marketplace of 18k+ actions**: Supported by GitHub and community, covering AWS, Azure, Terraform, Kubernetes, Slack, etc.  
- **Native caching, artifact storage, and matrix builds** without extra plugins.  
- **Custom actions**: Write in Docker, JavaScript, or composite YAML for portability.  

**Business Value**: Faster enablement, no plugin maintenance, and access to a growing ecosystem.

---

## 6. Cost & ROI

- **Eliminate Jenkins infrastructure**: No controller VMs, plugin updates, or admin overhead.  
- **Pay-per-use pricing** for GitHub-hosted runners; self-hosted runners cost only what you run.  
- **ARC autoscaling**: Runners scale to zero when idle, avoiding wasted compute.  

**Business Value**: Predictable costs, reduced infra spend, and better resource efficiency.

---

## 7. Velocity & Standardization

- **Templates & starter workflows**: Quickly bootstrap pipelines across repos.  
- **Org-level workflows**: Standardize CI/CD without duplicating job definitions.  
- **Cloud-native mindset**: Integrates cleanly with modern deployment patterns (Kubernetes, Terraform, serverless).  

**Business Value**: Faster onboarding for teams, consistent practices across the org, and quicker time-to-market.

# Jenkins OSS vs GitHub Actions – Comparison

| Category              | Jenkins OSS                                   | GitHub Actions                                   |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Security**          | Credentials stored in Jenkins; long-lived keys common. | Native OIDC to AWS/Azure/GCP (no long-lived keys); fine-grained workflow permissions. |
| **Operations**        | Requires managing controllers, agents, plugins, upgrades, backups. | SaaS-native: GitHub-hosted runners managed by GitHub; self-hosted/ARC optional. |
| **Plugins / Ecosystem** | Large plugin ecosystem; some outdated or poorly maintained. | 18k+ Actions in GitHub Marketplace; supported by GitHub and ecosystem partners. |
| **Integration**       | Requires webhooks or plugins for GitHub/SCM events. | Natively integrated with GitHub repos, PRs, issues, and releases. |
| **Governance**        | Role-based access via Jenkins; complex to enforce org-wide policies. | Environments, rulesets, branch protection, required reviewers, audit logging. |
| **Developer Experience** | Pipelines often defined in Jenkinsfile; detached from repo UX. | Workflows defined in repo (`.github/workflows/`); inline PR feedback & checks. |
| **Scalability**       | Requires scaling Jenkins masters and agents; often manual. | Elastic scaling with GitHub-hosted runners or ARC on Kubernetes. |
| **Maintenance**       | Continuous effort: patching controllers, upgrading plugins, troubleshooting. | Minimal maintenance; GitHub manages hosted runners, upgrades, and platform stability. |
| **Cost Model**        | Cost of servers + admin time + plugin maintenance. | Pay-per-use GitHub-hosted minutes, or self-hosted infra costs only. |
| **Velocity**          | Slower to standardize across many teams; shared libraries require upkeep. | Reusable workflows, starter templates, org-wide policies accelerate adoption. |

**How to prep**:  

- Study GitHub Docs → Actions runners, OIDC for AWS & Azure, reusable workflows.  
- Compare Jenkins plugin list vs Actions equivalents.  
- Build 1–2 demo workflows (AWS deploy, Azure deploy) to show parity.  
- Gather cost data for GitHub-hosted runners vs self-hosted.  
- Prepare a migration “playbook” (discovery → pilot → scale → retire Jenkins).
