**Subject:** Migration from Jenkins OSS to GitHub Actions – Feasibility and Path Forward  

Hi `<Name>`,

Yes, migrating to GitHub Actions is both feasible and can be executed quickly with the right approach.  
I will caustion that it is not easy, but with the right planning can be done smoothly.

Below is how I recommend we move forward, along with what “ASAP” looks like in practical terms.

## Why GitHub Actions is a Good Fit

- **Tighter integration**: Pipelines live alongside code in each repo, reducing context-switching.  
- **Security improvements**: Native OIDC federation to AWS and Azure removes the need for long-lived credentials.  
- **Plugin parity**: Common Jenkins plugins (AWS, Azure, Terraform, caching, notifications) have well-supported equivalents as first-party GitHub Actions.  
- **Governance**: Built-in policies, required status checks, and environment protection provide enterprise-level controls without separate tooling.  
- **Operational efficiency**: Eliminates overhead of patching and maintaining multiple Jenkins controllers and agents.

## “ASAP” Migration Timeline

- **Week 0–1**: Inventory jobs, configure OIDC to AWS/Azure, stand up GitHub-hosted and/or self-hosted runners, migrate 3–5 pilot pipelines.  
- **Week 2–4**: Standardize patterns into reusable workflows, onboard teams in waves.  
- **Week 5–6**: Retire Jenkins instances after validation period, finalize docs and guardrails.

_I have created an example project plan to help you get started [Jenkins->GitHub Actions Project Plan](../Q2/Basic_Project_Plan.md)_

## Plugin / Feature Parity

| Jenkins Plugin / Use Case        | GitHub Actions Equivalent                         |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| AWS Credentials, AssumeRole      | `aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials` (OIDC)    |
| Azure CLI / SP Auth              | `azure/login` with federated identity             |
| Pipeline Shared Library          | Reusable workflows & composite actions            |
| Multibranch Pipeline             | `on: push` + matrix strategies in workflow YAML   |
| Credentials Binding              | Environments, Secrets, and Variables              |
| Cron Jobs                        | `on: schedule`                                    |
| Artifacts                        | `actions/upload-artifact` / `download-artifact`   |
| Test Results                     | Built-in Checks API + annotations                 |

## Example: AWS Deployment with OIDC

```yaml
name: build-and-deploy-aws
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - run: npm ci && npm test
      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: dist
          path: dist/

  deploy:
    needs: build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      id-token: write
      contents: read
    environment: prod
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/download-artifact@v4
        with: { name: dist, path: dist/ }
      - uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v4
        with:
          role-to-assume: arn:aws:iam::<account>:role/github-actions-deployer
          aws-region: us-west-2
      - run: aws s3 sync dist/ s3://my-bucket --delete
```

### Key Risks & Mitigation

- **Secrets sprawl** → Replace with OIDC; store residual secrets in GitHub Encrypted Secrets.
- **Private networking needs** → Use self-hosted or ephemeral [Kubernetes-based runners (Actions Runner Controller)](https://github.com/actions/actions-runner-controller).
_for more information see [Self-hosted runners](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/runners/self-hosted-runners)_
- **Team learning curve** → Provide starter reusable workflows and training docs.
- **Parallel migration overhead** → Keep Jenkins read-only during cutover to allow rollback.

### Next Steps

1. Collect list of Jenkins controllers and top jobs.
    You can do this multiple ways. Options:  
    [Jekins metrics](https://plugins.jenkins.io/metrics/)  
    [Jenkins Prometheus Metrics](https://plugins.jenkins.io/prometheus/)  
    or using the Jenkins API [Example python script to export Jenkins Reports](https://github.com/jywebs/python-jenkins-reporter)
2. Enable OIDC providers in [AWS accounts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_create_oidc.html) and [Azure subscriptions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/configure-authentication-provider-openid-connect).
3. Select pilot repositories for lift-and-shift migrations.
4. Stand up runners in GitHub-hosted and private environments.

With some planning and this phased approach, you could begin a pilot project as early as this week and target full cutover within 4–6 weeks, which is agressive but possible.
I would be happy to meet with you to discuss these points in detail, answer any questions you may have, and help create a project plan for this important migration.
