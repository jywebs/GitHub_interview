# Presenter Notes – How AI Tools Improve Productivity in Development Workflows

## Slide 1: Introduction

Thank you so much for the opportunity to meet with you today.  
When we think about AI in software development, the real story isn’t about replacing developers—it’s about freeing them from repetitive work so they can focus on the problems that matter.  

**Today I’ll walk through:**

- A personal example from my own learning journey,
- What the data shows about AI’s impact,
- And how all of this translates into strategic outcomes for teams and customers.

**Point of note** - This is not a technical demo—it’s about impact and strategy.

**Additional talking points:**

~~- Remind audience of the framing question: *How can AI tools improve productivity in development workflows?*~~

## Slide 2: My Experience with Copilot

If you have anything to do with media today you have probably seen news articals saying something to the effect of - AI is coming for all of our jobs - **especially developers**.  
To me, AI isn’t about replacing developers. It’s about removing friction so they can focus on higher-value work.  

Before starting this process with GitHub, my experiance with GitHub was like, what I suspect many enterprise users is - just using GitHub as the Git repository UI.  
As part of preparing for this journey with GitHub, I wanted to dive deeper into features I would use if I were starting fresh, with a new product, company or just in the industry today.  

The feature I choose to prioritize getting comfortable with is **GitHub Copilot**. Because if you’re not using some kind of AI in your development workflow today, you’re getting left behind.  

I found out that Copilot gave me three things quickly that used to take me hours and were the least enjoyable in my daily tasks:

1. **Scaffolding** – After I created a PRD for my test project, I asked Copilot to built my codebase structure and base files and it did so accurately in seconds.  
2. **Unit tests** – Once I had the core code written, I used the Copilot chat and asked it to generate my unit tests. This replaced a task often done with frustration and many, many itterations.  
3. **Automation** – I told Copilot to create my Dockerfile and associated GitHub Actions workflow to build and push that docker container to my DockerHub and it did so quickly and efficiently.  

As I experimented more, I realized it could also help solve issues I documented in my repo (**espically in agent mode**). I did find that the better the issue was documented the better the resulting fix was. Honestly, it made me wish I had Copilot next to me on those 3 a.m. pager calls when a hotfix was needed 20 minutes ago.  

**Takeaway:** Copilot isn’t replacing developers — it’s more like a sidecar, giving developers leverage while allowing them to keep our hands on the wheel.  

**Additional talking points:**

- Mention how this experience pushed you beyond the “just Git UI” perception of GitHub.
- *leave for closing* - ~~Add your meta-example: *Using Copilot, I even built this presentation deck with impress.js and deployed it on GitHub Pages.*~~

## Slide 3: Strategic Impact – Why It Matters

My experience isn’t unique.  
A GitHub study found developers completed coding tasks about **55% faster** with Copilot than without. That’s a massive productivity gain. Surveys also show that developers feel more productive, and that productivity scales across teams.  

**For customers, this means:**

- **Faster delivery** - Features are often promissed quickly by sales and marketing but slow to deliever. Use of tools like Copilot help to reduce that time to release by reducing the toil part of development  
- **Reduction in technical debit** - No one likes talking about it but technical debit is real. Using thinks tools like Copilot Agent to help resolve low impact high frequency issues helps to improve overall job satification  
- **Stronger resilience** - Utilizing AI to help build and impliment test cases enables better testing coverage. Helping to resolve potential issues before they are pushed to production  
- **Better developer experience** - Overall this translates into higher morale and retention of talent GitHub's customers fight so hard to recruit.  

**Key Points:**  

- These impacts are not just to the developers but to the business as a whole
- AI isn’t just saving time—it’s changing *where* that time gets invested  

**Source:** GitHub Copilot study [arXiv: 2302.06590](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06590)  

**Additional talking points:**

- Reinforce “time saved vs. time reinvested” theme.  
- If pressed for metrics: Reference [Atlassian recent study](https://www.techradar.com/pro/ai-is-helping-developers-save-time-but-the-struggle-to-find-timely-information-is-costing-businesses-millions) and [Microsoft 2025 Study](https://www.itpro.com/software/development/microsoft-claims-ai-is-augmenting-developers-rather-than-replacing-them) studies showing ~10 hours saved per developer per week.  
- Tie to customer impact: “This isn’t just a developer story—it’s a business story.”

## Slide 4: Guardrails & Oversight

AI is powerful, but it isn’t perfect. Left unchecked, it can introduce risks that outweigh the productivity gains. Oversight really matters in three areas:  

1. **Code Quality & Standards**  
   AI code may look correct but fail to align with team conventions, security practices, or performance requirements.  
   *In my project, I validated Copilot’s workflow suggestions against CI/CD standards to ensure consistency and avoid rework.*  

2. **Long-Term Maintainability**  
   Accepting AI output blindly risks building “vibe code”—works now, but harder to maintain, debug, and scale.  
   Guardrails like peer reviews, automated testing, and linting keep quality high.  

3. **Customer Trust**  
   Enterprises want speed, but not at the cost of reliability.  
   Human-in-the-loop reviews, security scanning, and usage guidelines reassure customers that AI is an enhancer, not a liability.  

**Lesson:** AI accelerates the work, but oversight turns acceleration into sustainable progress. That’s what builds confidence in both the tool and the outcomes.  

**Additional talking points:**

- Share a “what if we didn’t have guardrails” example (tech debt, security bugs, inconsistent workflows).
- Tie back to your leadership mindset: “Guardrails aren’t just about preventing mistakes—they’re about enabling trust at scale.”

## Slide 5: Looking Ahead / Closing

As I look ahead, I don’t see AI replacing developers—I see AI elevating developers.  

**What AI does best:** Handling repetitive, low-value tasks like scaffolding, boilerplate, unit tests, and workflows.  
**What developers do best:** Problem-solving, system design, and delivering customer value.  

**Partnership with AI = two outcomes:**  

- **Productivity gains today** → faster delivery, shorter development cycle times.  
- **Strategic gains tomorrow** → higher employee satisfaction, stronger retention, a culture focused on **creativity over toil**  

**meta-example:** “This very presentation was built with the aid of GitHub Copilot and published using GitHub Pages quickly and efficency with only limited knowledge of javascript — to me that’s AI productivity in action.”  

**Closing Thoughts:**  

- GitHub's stated mission is "Empowering developers to build better software, faster." and that is just what Copilot enables developers to do  
- So the real question isn’t whether AI saves time — it’s how we reinvest the time it saves.  

**Additional talking points:**

- Invite discussion: “How do you see AI fitting into your workflows?”
