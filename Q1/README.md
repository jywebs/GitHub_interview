Contains the research and potential clarifying questions for Email response Question 1

# Question 1:
We‚Äôre trying to standardize our branching strategies across teams. Team A is currently doing Git flow while Team B is doing Trunk-based Development. Which one is better? Which one should we pick?

## Answer:
[Trunk-Based vs Git Flow Development Recommendation](Trunk_Response.md)

# Clarifying Questions:

## Release cadence & delivery

- How often do your teams aim to release to production (daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly)?

- Do you need to support multiple versions of the product in production at the same time? For how long?

- Are there contractual or regulatory requirements that force you to harden/stage code before release?

## Team workflow & practices

- How comfortable are teams with feature flags or toggles to manage incomplete work?

- How mature is your automated test coverage ‚Äî can you reliably trust green builds to mean ‚Äúsafe to deploy‚Äù?

- Do teams practice CI (every commit to main is tested and integrated) or rely on longer QA cycles?

## Risk & compliance

- Are there strict compliance checks or audits that require staged sign-offs before code reaches production?

- How do you currently manage hotfixes ‚Äî do you need an isolated hotfix branch, or can urgent fixes land directly in main?

## Organizational scale & coordination

- How many developers typically contribute to a repo at the same time?

- Do multiple teams work in parallel on the same product, or are teams mostly siloed to their own services?

- Is onboarding to the current branching model a barrier for new contributors?

## Tooling & enforcement

- Do you already have GitHub branch protections, merge queues, and CI/CD pipelines in place?

- Do you have a standardized approach to tagging releases and managing release notes?

## MarkDown Version
We are evaluating whether **Trunk-Based Development (TBD)** or **Gitflow** is the best standard branching model for our teams.  
Please take a few minutes to answer these questions based on your team‚Äôs current practices and needs.

## Release Cadence & Delivery
1. How often does your team typically release to production?
   - [ ] Daily
   - [ ] Weekly
   - [ ] Monthly
   - [ ] Quarterly or less
2. Do you need to support multiple versions of the product in production at the same time?
   - [ ] Yes  
   - [ ] No  
   - If yes, for how long do you support each version? (e.g., 3 months, 1 year, etc.)
3. Do you require a separate hardening/stabilization period before release?  
   - [ ] Yes  
   - [ ] No  

## Team Workflow & Practices
4. Does your team use feature flags/toggles for incomplete work?  
   - [ ] Yes, regularly  
   - [ ] Occasionally  
   - [ ] Not at all  
5. How confident are you in your automated test coverage?  
   - [ ] Very confident ‚Äì green build = releasable  
   - [ ] Somewhat confident ‚Äì still need manual checks  
   - [ ] Low confidence ‚Äì rely heavily on manual QA  

## Risk & Compliance

9. Do multiple teams contribute to the same codebase simultaneously?  
   - [ ] Yes  
   - [ ] No  

## Tooling & Enforcement
10. Does your repo already enforce branch protections (e.g., required PRs, checks, merge queue)?  
    - [ ] Yes  
    - [ ] No  
11. Do you have a standardized process for tagging releases and writing release notes?  
    - [ ] Yes  
    - [ ] No
